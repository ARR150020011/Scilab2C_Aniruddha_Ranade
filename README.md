# Scilab2C_Aniruddha_Ranade

I have attempted the Part B of the assignment.I have used atmel studio for programming. 
The questions and corresponding files for them are as follows:
Q4a::led_switch_001
    If switch is on (high) led is on and if switch is off (low) led is off .
Q4b::potentiometer_uart_001
    Two bytes sent to PC are ADCH and ADCL . 8 bits of ADCL and least significant 2 bits of ADCH together correspond to the reading. 
Q5::default_clock_and_timer_001
    The clock is set to 8MHz as required. And a CTC mode is used to generate a wave form of 2Khz on pin OC1A using timer 1 and OCR1A.

Thank You
